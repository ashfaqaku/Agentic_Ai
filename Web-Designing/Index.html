    <p>Ovalipes catharus, commonly known as the paddle crab, swimming crab, or pāpaka in Māori, is a species of crab
        found in shallow, sandy-bottomed waters around the coasts of New Zealand, the Chatham Islands, and uncommonly in
        southern Australia. This species is an opportunistic, aggressive, and versatile feeder active mostly at night,
        preying predominantly on molluscs and crustaceans. It is also highly prone to cannibalism, which accounts for
        over a quarter of its diet in some locations. The crab's paddle-shaped rear legs and streamlined carapace allow
        it to capture prey by swimming rapidly and to escape predation by burrowing in the sand. Its mating season is in
        winter and spring, after which the female likely moves into deeper waters to incubate and disperse her larvae.
        Commercial fisheries have harvested paddle crabs since the 1970s, and O. catharus is present in Māori culture as
        both an artistic motif and as a traditional source of food. (Full article...)
