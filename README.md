1. Sum of Natural Numbers

Write a Python program using a for loop to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers (where n is entered by the user).
Example: if n = 5, output → 15.

2. Multiplication Table Generator

Ask the user for a number, and print its multiplication table up to 10 using a for loop.
Example for 3:

3 x 1 = 3  
3 x 2 = 6  
...  
3 x 10 = 30

3. Count Vowels in a String

Take a string input from the user and use a for loop to count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) it contains.
Print the total number of vowels found.

4. Reverse a String

Ask the user to input a word and print it in reverse order using a for loop (without using slicing [::-1]).
Example: Input → "hello", Output → "olleh".

5. Display Even Numbers from a List

Given a predefined list of integers, use a for loop to print only the even numbers from it.
Example: For [10, 15, 20, 25, 30] → Output: 10, 20, 30.
